# Windows Server Features Lab (VMware)

This project explores the deployment and management of Windows Server in a VMware virtualized environment. The lab covers foundational server tasks, including installation, configuration, remote management, web hosting, routing, file services, software RAID, and shadow copy.

## üìö Project Overview

- **Platform:** VMware Workstation/Player
- **OS:** Windows Server (Standard with GUI)
- **Client:** Windows machine or VM
